Write a program to blink the built-in LED to encode the message “SOS” in Morse code. In
Morse code, each letter is represented by a series of dots (short tones) and dashes (long
tones). You should write a program that replicates this pattern on the LED. For dots, the LED
should blink at around twice the speed/frequency of dashes.
In Morse code, the letter “S” is represented by three dots, and the letter “O” is represented by
three dashes.
